# CSE-368-Project

**Motivation/Introduction**

In the interest of public safety and the limitations in human monitoring capabilities, the integration of artificial intelligence in facial recognition technology could allow for the automatic detection of unfamiliar faces in real-time, thereby enhancing situational awareness and security of particularly vulnerable areas such as hospitals, nursing homes, schools, etc.

AI can visualize data at a speed that humans are not capable of, enabling timely alerts to authorities when unfamiliar or potentially dangerous individuals are detected. This project aims to develop facial recognition software that identifies unfamiliar faces in designated areas, and if so, then notifies the appropriate authorities, thus fostering a safer environment.
